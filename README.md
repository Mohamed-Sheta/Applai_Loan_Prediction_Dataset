# ***Loan Prediction Analysis & Machine Learning Model***
This project analyzes a loan prediction dataset to identify the key factors influencing loan approval and builds a machine learning model to predict whether an applicant’s loan will be approved. The workflow includes:

- Data Exploration & Cleaning – Handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing feature distributions, correlations, and patterns that impact loan approval.

- Feature Engineering – Creating new features and selecting the most important predictors.

- Model Training & Evaluation – Implementing and comparing multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) with performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Insights & Recommendations – Highlighting the factors that most strongly influence approval rates.
