## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

### 🔹 Supervised Machine Learning  
A range of supervised learning algorithms were implemented for data classification and analysis:  
- Logistic Regression  
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- XGBoost  

### 🔹 Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
An interactive and user-friendly **GUI** was built using **Streamlit** to showcase model predictions and results.
